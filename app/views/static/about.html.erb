  <h1>About the Catalogue</h1>
</div>
<p>Development of a "Catalogue of Assessments" was called for by the meeting which established the <a href="http://www.ipbes.net">Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services</a> (IPBES). The primary intention was to learn lessons from existing and ongoing assessment processes so as to inform the future development of IPBES, and a critical review of assessments to be delivered to the first IPBES Plenary will draw heavily on the catalogue.</p>
<p>In developing the "Catalogue of Assessments", the Interim Secretariat decided to develop and implement an online catalogue which would be developed and maintained with the direct involvement of assessment practitioners, and which would be widely accessible. In addition to providing information on the assessments and lessons learnt, the intention is that this online catalogue also provide direct access to assessment reports, guidelines, and so on as a resource for practitioners, and in this regard the catalogue is being developed with the close involvement of the <a href="http://www.ecosystemassessments.net/">Sub-Global Assessment Network</a>.</p>
<p>Those using the "Catalogue of Assessments" are invited both to contribute information on the assessments with which they are involved, and to provide feedback on the form and function of the "Catalogue of Assessments", and on any ways in which it could be improved to better serve their needs.</p>
